										<h1>Personal Experience in STEM</h1>

										<h3>Who am I</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I'm Siyuan, pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Math at the University of Maryland, College Park. Recently,
										I also accept the Ph.D offer to continue my research in the field of Computer Vision. I want to share my personal experience as a STEM
										major student in undergraduate CS courses and graduate TA office.
									</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>What I see</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The Maryland Center for Women in Computing states that “20% of our undergraduate students are women majoring in computer science.” 
										This figure aligns with my impression of the introductory computer science classes. Lower-level CS classes, CMSC131 and CMSC132, 
										should have the highest percentage of female students as all cs students are required to take and they are the mandatory courses for 
										any who want to enter the CS major. When I was taking a high-level 400 course, I counted that 4 out of 30 students were female. This
										is very alarming figure. UMD claims to have the most number of female students. This means that there are many other university and 
										college that has much worse ratio.
									</p>
									<p>
										When it comes to graduate school, things get worse. I served as an undergraduate research assistant for the past two years so I constantly 
										visit the graduate student office. Although the following figures may not be representative of the department or all STEM majors, only 2 
										graduate students are working in that office which contains about 20 seats. This is also an example of the leaky pipeline phenomena. 
										As female students enter the CS major, some of them drop out of the major as courses get harder. Even less female students decide to continue 
										their study in graduate school.

										<h3>University Efforts</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I also notice the University and the department use their best efforts to improve female student's representation in the STEM major.
										One important orgnization at UMD cs department is <a herf="https://inclusion.cs.umd.edu/mcwic"> The Maryland Center for Women in Computing. </a>
										According to their website, it provides supports, mentorship and education for womens whose major is in computing field at UMD. I can envision that
										for any women who lost in studying CS or unsure about the future career, this resrouce will be a great place to ask for help. With in the engineering department,
										we have the <a herf="https://eng.umd.edu/women">Women in Enginerring Program</a> that dedicates to "promoting the role of women in the field of engineering." This Program
										offers a variety of resources. To name a fiew: Tutoring Service, WIE Connect Peer Mentoring Program, Technical Workship. This will be a great help for 
										female engineering students.
