										<h1>Interview with Rebecca</h1>

										<h2 id="content">Interview Introduction</h2>
											<p>I interviewed Rebecca on March 24th, 2022. She is a senior environmental science student at Carleton College. We had a discussion about
												female represenatation in STEM major at her college. It's interesting to find that female students are dominant in certain STEM majors.</p>

										<h2 id="content">Highlights</h2>
											<p>
												Rebecca had a strong interest with the natural world. Just as she said, "I not only can learn new stuff but also the humanity part of nature attracts me especially."
												There was a strong motivation pushing her: from her childhood, through highschool and it will not end at college period. 

												I was expecting that environmental science has an equal gender ratio because, like Rebecca said, enrionment science is a women-friendly major.
												Surprisingly, it looks like that female students dominate this major at school but less students pursue a further education, 
												resulting less women scientists at the academic conference. This fits the definition of Leaky Pipe. Also, when Rebecca talks about her future goal to pursue a PhD degree, 
												she sounds indecisive and wants to become a research assistant first. This is partly becuase, and Rebecca implicitly agrees, that the female representation in STEM-related
												fields. With more females, I believe she will pursue her career firmly.

										<h2 id="content">Interview Transcript</h2>
	
											<p>Siyuan: Thanks for giving me this opportunity to interview you regarding women in STEM. Why don’t we start from the time when you were a child.</p>

												<p>Rebecca: Sure</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What did you know about your STEM field when you were a child?</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: When I was a child, my understanding of earth science or the environment probably came from going on trips with my mom and dad every time I was on vacation, and these trips allowed me to see a lot of human and natural landscapes. I was familiar with some of them but there were also completely unknown and new ones. I found it particularly interesting to learn about the causes behind them and the relationship between human beings and nature. But at that time I hadn't thought of such a grand philosophical topic of man and nature, but I felt that when I was in a different environment, I not only can learn new stuff but also the humanity part of nature attracts me especially.</p>
												<p>Siyuan: I know you took environmental science class when you were at high school. My question is:</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>Why do you choose environmental science as your major? Were you inspired by someone?</b></p>
												<p>Rebecca: I’ve always been quite interested in doing something environment-related. I think a big part of my interest comes from growing up in Beijing and being constantly exposed to air pollution and other environmental issues and the feeling that something needs to be done to address such issues.</p>
												<p>Siyuan: Nice, it is a problem that needs urgent attention. I really want to learn more about environmental science.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What are some really cool things that people in your field do?</b>
												</p>
												<p>Rebecca: Environmental science/studies majors go into a variety of fields because of the interdisciplinary nature of this major. People go into ecology research, renewable energy sector, or even policy-related work. I have friends who’re interested in marine biology and want to do conservation/climate change research in a marine environment.
												 </p>
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What’s the gender ratio in your major? Do you feel that female students are underrepresented in your major? What about STEM in general?</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: It is surprisingly not male dominated and with predominantly female and non-binary students. I think what contributes to that ratio is because there is the belief that Environmental fields are not considered hard sciences.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: Wow, it’s good to hear that there are some subjects of the STEM majors are not male-dominated. Actually, “hard science: is a phrase contains gender bias. People thinks only boys are suitable for hard science and women don’t. Do you feel the same way?</p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: No, it’s not. There are definitely some exceptional women scientists in STEM fields. Even in the computer science area, where men are dominate population, we have some very famous female computer scientists such as Ada Lovelace.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>Do you, as a female student, encounter any obstacles when pursuing your career goal at school or outside of school?</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: I think Environmental fields are probably one of the most women-friendly fields (or just a friendly field) and people are generally respectful and genuine. So far, I don't feel that being a woman has caused me any hindrance or difficulty in finding professional opportunities, but I did notice a very unequal ratio of men to women when I attended my first academic conference, American middle logical society. But this is not the case in our school and as other institutions that I've learned about. So I think this discipline does not fully reflect the unequal treatment of women in the stem environment, but what I learned by going to this conference, watching some documentaries, on a broader scale must be more representative.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: yeah. That’s something we need to change. </p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: After my gap year I would like to do a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences. Besides the atmosphere, I really like forests, water, and nature. I would like to connect the different parts of nature, or different fields, so that we can better understand the changes in nature. It is unknown what I will do after my PhD, but I am sure that I would like to continue my research in an interdisciplinary institution.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: That is great!</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>As it approaches graduation, what’s your plan after graduation? Do you plan to pursue a career in the STEM area? Why or why not.</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: After graduating from undergraduate school, my plan is to take a year off, and then try my best to find some research opportunities during my gap year. Trying to do be a research assistant or technician to understand more about the field I want to go into in the future, and what kind of work environment it is. Because I think the study of environmental science or study of atmospheric science is a test of hands-on ability, physical and mental qualities. It does not only needs labs, fields, and some data analysis, but also a lot of sharing of scientific results, which may involve some interdisciplinary communication and cooperation. So I would like to experience such a research environment.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: Hope you can enjoy your research environment.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What’s your take on why women are underrepresented in STEM majors?</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca:A lack of representation. When a field is traditionally male-dominated it is hard for young women to envision themselves being in such fields. This is a problem that should be addressed in elementary/middle school. </p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What university/college can do, in your opinion, to eliminate gender inequality?</b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: Design their curriculum carefully and include components that ask their students to reflect on prejudice, biases, and stereotypes of their major. I have a friend who is a Physics major and her courses include a component where students are asked to reflect on how they can make the major more inclusive to women, non-binary students, and BIPOC students. </p>
												
												
												<p>Siyuan: <b>What inspirational message would you give young girls to inspire them to pursue STEM? </b></p>
												
												<p>Rebecca: Stick to what you’re passionate about and don’t be afraid to ask for help. Also don’t feel pressured to pursue a STEM major just because it is breaking the gender stereotype.</p>
												
												<p>Siyuan: Awesome. This is great advice. I think that’s all questions I have. Thanks for your time!</p>
