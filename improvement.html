									<p>We need to change the current situation that female does not have equal represenation in 
										STEM majors. If we want to attract the best and brightest minds into the fields, 
										we have to consider all of the population. More women can contribute to our field, 
										and we can make that happen. In the following sections, I proposed 5 suggestions to increase 
										the female representation.

											<p>
												The very first step of resolving this issue is to letting more people to understand the existance and 
												the importance of the matter. This website aims to broadcast it, hoping to attract more attention from
												the society and the educational institution.

												<h3>Provide more resources to younge girls</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												At early stage of the education, we should encouage girls to join STEM programs by offering more
												resources, such as female STEM club, female STEM program, female STEM activities. Although focusing on one female age group,
												would not resolve this sociological issue, we can at least correcting people's false assumptions that girls are not
												good at math and science. The school and administrators should also aim to create an equal learning and studying environment
												for younge girls.

												<h3>Enrich learning opportunities from the community</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												National clubs are paying more attention to women students in STEM. A new club has been established in 2017 called <a herf="https://womeninstem.org/">Women in STEM</a> to 
												unit and assist girls in STEM majors. Tech giant company, such as google,initilize <a herf="https://mexicobusiness.news/tech/news/google-unveils-program-boost-female-engineers-stem">programs</a> 
												that targted female engineers to increase job opportunities in the cloud computing industry during 
												the summer. Many firms also offers job shadowing programs or career days that gives potential female employees an 
												opportunity to observe typical daily job duties and actiities.

												<h3>Serving as Mentor</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												One big problems of this issue is the lack of female mentor. Mentor is like a lighthouse in the sea, offering suggestions and assistant.
												Therefore, we encouarge more success female figures to serve student mentor. They should be not only willing to spend their time teaching techniques and processes, 
												but also interested in long-term development. Working with a mentor is a career strategy that can bring significant benefits and we courage more and 
												more female students to look for one.

										<h2>Leaky Pipline</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The "leaky pipeline" metaphor describes the way in which women become underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields. In mathematics 
										and engineering the disequilibrium starts before undergrad, with fewer women choosing to major in these fields. Conversely, women in 
										the biological and life sciences represent more than half of the students earning PhDs, yet most fail to achieve tenure track faculty positions in academia.
